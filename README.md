"# Human_face_detection" 

What is this?

This project detects human faces in images and webcam video. It uses HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) to find image patterns and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to check if theyâ€™re faces. Haar Cascade helps spot faces quickly in video.

What it does





Labels images as "face" or "non-face" and saves them.



Finds HOG patterns in images for face detection.



Trains SVM to recognize faces.



Shows faces in webcam video with green boxes.
